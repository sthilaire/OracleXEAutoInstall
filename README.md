# OracleXESimpleInstall
Installation Automation scripts for Oracle XE, APEX, ORDS for OEL Linux

# Who This Is For
Do you want to learn Oralce APEX?  Do you want to learn APEX administration? Do you want a playground you can try stuff out in without impacting others? Are you not an infrastructure wizard?

If these statements are true, this project may be for you.

This is a series of script automations for installing the primary technologies for a basic APEX stack without a lot of complexity.  It is intended to be easy to start with very little configuration or additional steps.


# Prerequisites
A Host - such as Oracle VM Virtual Box
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/virtualbox/downloads/index.html
Oracle Enterprise Linux Installation - recommended because dependancies are included
On that host:
Download APEX
Download XE
Download ORDS
Download This project

# OR - Built VMs
XE too limited for you?  OTN distributes pre built VMS with production versions of Oracle already installed.  I recommend the "Database App Development VM", but the "Upgrade and Migration Hands-on Lab" is also excellent with multiple Oracle versions.
